Package builders who want to configure the library for standard
     locations, but have the package installed somewhere else so that
     it can easily be packaged, can use

       $ make INSTALL_PREFIX=/tmp/package-root install

     (or specify "--install_prefix=/tmp/package-root" as a configure
     option).  The specified prefix will be prepended to all
     installation target filenames.
